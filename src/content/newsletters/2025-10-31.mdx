### `sibling-count()` and `sibling-index()`

These are relatively new CSS functions that enable authors to style or animate elements differently depending on how
many siblings they have and where they appear in that list.
This month we implemented support for these. (PRs [#6426](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6426) and
[#6526](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6526))

### Accessibility DevTools

Since switching away from our own inspector to using Firefox's developer tools, we've been missing a few features we
previously had. This month we reimplemented inspection of the accessibility tree - a structure parallel to the usual
element tree that represents how tools like screen readers see the page. We don't yet support such tools, but being able
to examine what's going on inside Ladybird will make that easier. (PR [#6462](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6462))

### CSS Typed OM progress

Continuing from last month, we're still working on the CSS Typed OM API, which allows authors to get and set style
properties using objects instead of strings. Ladybird now supports setting style with most types of CSSStyleValue.
(PRs [#6370](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6370), [#6378](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6378), [#6440](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6440), and [#6466](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird/pull/6466))

### Credits

We'd like to thank everyone who contributed code this month:
